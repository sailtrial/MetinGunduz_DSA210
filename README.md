# Project Description

For the next three months, I will systematically track and analyze how my daily habits (particularly smoking, a balanced macronutrient diet, and irregular sleep patterns) affect my testosterone levels.

Unlike my fellow participant, who follows a high-protein diet, regular exercise, and a structured sleep schedule, my routine includes:

- A balanced diet with a mix of protein, fats, and carbohydrates
- Maintaining current body weight instead of weight loss
- Regular smoking
- Irregular sleep patterns

By comparing my final results with my fellow participant's, I aim to identify how these different lifestyle choices impact testosterone levels and overall health.

## Objectives

### Evaluate the Effect of Balanced Nutrition on Testosterone
- Determine how a balanced macronutrient diet influences testosterone production compared to a high-protein diet.

### Analyze the Relationship Between Smoking and Hormone Levels
- Assess the potential impact of regular smoking on testosterone levels and compare it with a non-smoker's results.

### Assess the Effect of Irregular Sleep Patterns
- Examine whether sleep inconsistency contributes to hormonal imbalances.

### Compare My Results with My Fellow Participant‚Äôs
- Evaluate how different lifestyle factors (smoking, nutrition, and sleep) influence testosterone levels and overall health.

### Use Data Analysis to Identify Trends and Insights
- Apply statistical methods to uncover patterns in hormonal fluctuations.

## Dataset Description

I will collect daily lifestyle habit data and measure bi-weekly testosterone levels through blood tests.

### Daily Collected Data:
- **Total Calories Consumed** (kcal)
- **Macronutrient Breakdown**: Protein (g), Fat (g), Carbohydrates (g)
- **Exercise Data**: Whether I exercised or not, and the type of workout performed
- **Alcohol Consumption** (Yes/No)
- **Water Intake** (Liters per day)
- **Sleep Duration** (Hours per night)
- **Number of Cigarettes Smoked** (per day)

### Bi-Weekly Blood Test Measurements:
- **Testosterone Levels** (ng/dL)

### Comparative Factor:
My results will be compared to my fellow participant's, who follows a high-protein diet, does not smoke, and maintains a structured sleep schedule.

## Hypothesis

- **H‚ÇÄ (Null Hypothesis):** My daily habits do not significantly influence testosterone levels.
- **H‚ÇÅ (Alternative Hypothesis):** My balanced diet, smoking, and irregular sleep patterns significantly influence testosterone levels over time.

### Expected Outcomes:
- My testosterone levels may fluctuate more compared to my fellow participant's due to irregular sleep patterns.
- Smoking might have a suppressing effect on testosterone production.
- A balanced diet may lead to stable but lower testosterone compared to a high-protein diet.
- Cholesterol levels and liver function markers may show noticeable differences due to smoking and dietary variations.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- I will log all nutritional intake, smoking habits, and sleep patterns daily.
- Bi-weekly blood tests will provide testosterone and other health marker readings.

### 2. Data Processing
- Convert all raw data into structured formats.
- Handle outliers or anomalies (e.g., extreme fatigue, sickness).

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generate time-series graphs to visualize testosterone trends.
- Use correlation heatmaps to identify key relationships between habits and hormonal levels.

### 4. Hypothesis Testing
- Perform paired t-tests to check whether smoking, diet, and sleep irregularities impact testosterone levels.
- Use regression models to identify the most influential lifestyle factors.

### 5. Comparative Analysis
- Compare my testosterone levels, cholesterol profile, and electrolyte balance with my fellow participant‚Äôs.
- Analyze how smoking, balanced nutrition, and irregular sleep impact testosterone differently compared to structured lifestyle choices.
- Generate visual comparisons between our datasets to highlight major trends.

## Visualization Plan

- **Line Graphs** ‚Üí Track testosterone fluctuations over time.
- **Scatter Plots** ‚Üí Identify correlations between testosterone levels and different habits.
- **Heatmaps** ‚Üí Analyze the relationships between various biomarkers.
- **Bar Charts** ‚Üí Compare testosterone levels across different habit groups (sleep, smoking, diet, etc.).
- **Side-by-Side Comparisons** ‚Üí Evaluate key differences between my results and my fellow participant's.

---

## Tools & Technologies

I will use the following tools for data collection and analysis:

- **Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets** ‚Üí Logging daily habits and blood test results.
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)** ‚Üí Data analysis and visualization.
- **Statistical Tests (t-tests, Regression Models)** ‚Üí Hypothesis validation.

## Final Deliverables

By the end of the project, I will produce:

üìå A detailed report summarizing my findings, statistical insights, and conclusions.

üìå Data visualizations illustrating testosterone trends and how they relate to my lifestyle habits.

üìå A comparative analysis of my habits and blood test results vs. my fellow participant‚Äôs.

üìå Key takeaways and recommendations regarding the effects of different lifestyle habits on testosterone.

## Conclusion

Through this project, I aim to quantify the impact of smoking, balanced nutrition, and irregular sleep on testosterone levels. By systematically tracking my habits and comparing my results with a non-smoker who follows a structured routine, I hope to determine which lifestyle choices positively or negatively influence hormonal health.

At the end of the study, I will compare my results with my fellow participant‚Äôs to analyze the impact of smoking, nutrition, and sleep patterns on testosterone levels. This comparative analysis will provide a clearer picture of how different lifestyle habits shape hormonal health over time.

This study will not only help me optimize my own testosterone levels but could also offer valuable insights for others interested in the effects of daily habits on hormone regulation.
